# SPORT GROUPING

By accessing the "Access Control" and selecting the "Sports Grouping" option, a screen will be displayed with the sports player in groups. 

Sport grouping is a place where the user will be able to play through a link, but only with specific games. For example, if there is another type of game, there is the possibility of playing in sport grouping, he logs in through the link and will be redirected to the NFboost application.

Entering NFboost the player will be able to participate in the same events as the other player who just wants to login through Sport Grouping.
