In the "Manage NFT" modal, some information needs to be filled in:

- MINT: In Mint, the user must define the amount of NFTs to be registered in the Blockchain. 

- PUBLISH: After Mint, the quantity available to be published must be defined so that the user can buy.

- RECALL: Recall serves to redeem back the amount of NFTs that were published.

- VALUE: The values of the NFTs can be edited when necessary.

- BURN: After doing the Recall, the NFTs may or may not Burn. This means NFTs will be destroyed. After that, the user will be able to delete the NFT.
