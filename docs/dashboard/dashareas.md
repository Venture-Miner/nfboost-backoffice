# DASHBOARD AREAS

As we use NFT and blockchain technology to facilitate the visualization of the balance and address, the admin user has this information in the Dashboard.

It is also possible to track the totals of services by the indicators:

- Total Users: Displays the number of registered users on the platform.

- Total NFTs: Displays the amount of non-fungible token (NFT) created on the platform.

- Total Items: Displays the amount of items created on the platform.

- Active Events: Displays the number of active events registered on the platform.
